## Assignment 7 - Code Review

Overall, the implementation and code we were given was impeccable. My partner and I were absolutely blown away by the neatness and overall quality of the code we received, and it made completing assignment 7 very enjoyable.

### Design Critique:
We have absolutely no complaints about the design of the program. Everything was well separated using MCV principles, and even beyond that, every function was separated into its own class. Also the expert use of interfaces and abstract classes with these models made it incredibly easy to extend the functionality of the code we were given to add the mosaic function. Overall, the design was impeccable.

### Implementation Critique:
Similarly, we also have no complaints about the implementation of the program. While we didn’t read through every single line of code in the project, everything we read through made sense and seemed very logical and efficient, allowing us to easily understand what was going on in each portion of the code. It was interesting to store the data for the pixels in a 3d array of integers (we chose a 2d array of ColorPixels, a class we created) but the solution seemed to work well and efficiently!

### Documentation Critique:
This is where our only critique comes. While the code we were given had helpful javadocs and things like that, there was no documentation within the code about what each step was doing. As a habit for myself, especially with partner work, I document every single step in the code I’m writing, writing the comments first before actually adding the implementation. This makes it extremely easy for anyone to understand what is happening in the code, without having to read through the implementation. When trying to understand the code, comments like these would have been very helpful, and I wish there was more documentation in the code itself.

### Design/Code Strengths:
Overall, the design and implementation of everything was incredibly easy to extend, and seemingly was designed and written with this in mind. Everything was separated into its own classes, and interfaces and abstract classes prevented any duplication which was another huge bonus. Overall, the extensibility of the code written was a huge strength.

### Design/Code Weaknesses:
The only weaknesses my partner and I were able to identify was the lack of documentation within the code itself. Adding comments for each line of code is a great habit to get into, both when working with partners, but even when working individually, it allows you to easily skim code and understand what’s going on! The only other potential limitation to the code would be that a new model object has to be created for every transformation run, which could slow down the program and decrease efficiency, even if it allows for easier extendability.
